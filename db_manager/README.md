# DB_Manager Local Package
I wanted to introduce the database manager as a separated python package because it is a general purpose module may be used in other projects.

It can be run and configured in any context. Please note the `db_connection.yaml` file under `configurations` directory. It is introduced to let you be able to configure your db connection confiugrations like host, port, db_name, .. etc. without the need to make any change in the db_manager package.

*A better version for this file will be written as soon as possible.
