# CarHireManagementSystem
The main focus of the business is renting cars and vans, and the database is to manage the booking system.

please activate the venv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first to install project's dependencies.

Please note that the [database manager](db_manager/README.md) is introduced as a separated python package because it is a general purpose module may be used in other projects.


Please note also, you can find the [database ERD](database%20design/ER_diagram.png) and the [sql file](database%20design/car_hire.sql) under `database design` directory. I will add an ERM diagram also.

*A better version for this file will be written as soon as possible.
